## Authors

- **Eli Ronai**
- **Austyn Harriman**

Time taken: **2.5 hours**

## Features

- **Interactive Color Wheels**: Two color wheels to select and display RGB vectors.

- **Cosine Similarity & Theta**: Computes and displays the cosine similarity between vectors and the Theta (angle of difference).

- **3D Visualization**: Provides a 3D visualization of the two RGB vectors. Allows interaction via scrolling and panning to view from different angles.

- **Background Theta display**: Background gradient angle corresponds to Theta.

## Quick Start
