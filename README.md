## Authors

- **Eli Ronai**
- **Austyn Harriman**

Crafted in just **2.5 hours** for a quick and insightful demo, thanks to ChatGPT and the react-color library.

## Features

- **Interactive Color Wheels**: Dual color wheels to select and exhibit RGB vectors.

- **Cosine Similarity & Theta**: Computes and showcases the cosine similarity between vectors and the associated Theta (angle difference).

- **3D Visualization**: Presents a 3D visualization of the two RGB vectors, with scroll and pan interactions for varied viewing angles.

- **Background Theta display**: Background gradient angle resonates with Theta.
